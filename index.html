      		  				I have had a long habit of planning out things I wanted to do since I was a kid. I planned to be a doctor, like my dad, but even at age five, I knew it was going to be too much work before I could start living happily. Luckily, I had already been introduced to games and computers, and could aim for being a "techie". Before I could reach double digits, I had already become the computer pro for anyone I knew, as I knew Microsoft Office really well, as well as perusing the internet. In high school, I had become known as the guy who could hack any console. But during this time, I had stagnated as a computer person because Debakey (High School for Health Professions) was healthcare oriented. Regardless of what we wanted to be, we all had to become knowledgeable of the healthcare field, of being a doctor, nurse, and even a dentist. After graduation, I attended the University of Houston, to pursue a major in computer science, and planned for that to be the end of it. I went to school full-time, and worked part-time initially, however, due to unforeseen familial circumstances, I quickly became a full-time worker, followed by dropping out of college.

										Maybe the anime character in me had a stronger say in things than I had thought, but I built my own computer, the first computer I had actual access to, with the goal of learning anything I could about programming, about tech, and of course, play maxed out games. By this point, I had become a good member of a bakery, and the years following would have me more invested in the bakery than anything else. I became the bakery manager very shortly, and with it, all my time had gone. I hadn't known if I'd go back to school; i was in a mighty difficult situation with the university, so I opted in to learn javascript and c++ using Udemy. Soon after, I had decided to back to school, and was set to go. On the final day, twelve hours remaining, in which we needed to submit financial information the the school, I saw an ad for the University of Austin's bootcamp, and immediately knew my decision.

										I am a big gamer, more so when I was younger than now, but I still get excited every June for E3. If I'm not indoors, I could be at the gym, or doing anything that is physical. I am trying to get back into reading books, but I can't because I waste all my time reading articles. I plan to travel a lot, and do things you've probably seen from the view of a go pro. I'm pretty passionate about the idea of doing more than developing: finishing my learning of Japanese, Korean, and Spanish; volunteering overseas, and giving back to neighborhoods. Because of Uber, I have heard many opinions of Houston from foreigners, and it has made me really fall in love with the awesome city. I want to be here as long as it takes to finish HWY 290, or until traffic reaches the levels found in California. I've gone on long enough. Thank you for reading!
